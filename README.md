# Latitude-E5470-OpenCore
My working copy of OpenCore for the Dell Latitude E5470 supporting Mojave through Big Sur.

At the time of writing, this contains a working OpenCore 0.6.3 image and configuration running Catalina (10.15.7) and Big Sur (11.0.1). 
This branch utilizes OpenCanopy, but does not include the required "Resources" folder - please pull the latest from OcBinaryData.

This branch also works with Mojave, but may require tweaks.
